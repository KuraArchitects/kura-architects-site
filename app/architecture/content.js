      'At Kura Architects, we offer more than architectural design — we offer structured, professional services that support well-informed decisions, reduce risk, and maintain momentum from concept to completion.',
      'Rooted in the RIBA Plan of Work, our approach is rigorous, accountable, and designed to guide clients through each stage of development with clarity and confidence.',
      'We work on behalf of private clients, developers, community organisations and commercial teams — adapting our service to suit the scale, complexity and ambitions of each commission.',

    paragraphs: [
      'Our work begins by understanding not just what a project is, but why it matters — what value it aims to unlock, what constraints it faces, and what outcomes it must deliver. We then structure our service to suit, working through each stage of the RIBA framework to define, develop, and realise the project.',
      "At Stage 0, we help clients shape their brief. This may involve analysing a site's potential, identifying risks, or testing alignment with funding, timescales or planning policy. Our role is to front-load the right questions, so decisions made later are based on sound foundations.",
      'During Stages 1 and 2, we develop early concept and feasibility designs. These are not just about aesthetics — they are spatial and technical responses to defined constraints. Whether the project is a new-build home, a change-of-use proposal, or a phased development, our studies consider buildability, cost, regulation and programme from the outset.',
      'By Stage 3, our design work matures into a coordinated scheme, suitable for planning submission and formal client sign-off. We prepare documents that clearly communicate design intent and performance expectations, working closely with planning consultants and statutory bodies to manage approval risk.',
      'At Stages 4 and 5, we move into technical delivery. This includes detailed design, specification, compliance coordination and construction support. For clients procuring via traditional or D&B routes, we prepare tender information and assist with contractor appointment. We also offer contract administration where required — providing oversight during construction to monitor quality, compliance and progress.',
      'After practical completion, we remain engaged through Stages 6 and 7. We support handover, help resolve any latent defects, and where appropriate, assist with post-occupancy review — enabling feedback to inform future use, adaptation or investment.',

    paragraphs: [
      'Our service is structured — but never rigid. Some clients appoint us to carry a project from concept to completion. Others seek targeted input: a feasibility study, planning support, or technical assistance on a part-built scheme. We are comfortable delivering a full architectural service or stepping in at a defined stage where clarity and experience are required.',
      'In every case, we act as trusted professionals. We document decisions, coordinate consultants, anticipate regulatory touchpoints, and remain responsive to programme and budget pressures. We don’t believe in over-complication — we believe in thoughtful solutions, clearly communicated.',
      'For example, on a recent urban infill scheme, we worked with a client from initial site acquisition through to delivery. Early-stage massing and access studies informed the purchase. A well-evidenced planning strategy helped secure approval without delay. And through Stage 4 technical design, we worked alongside the contractor to rationalise detailing for buildability — maintaining quality while reducing cost risk.',
